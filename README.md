# Credit Default Prediction ‚Äì XGBoost & Power BI Dashboard üìä

This project tackles the challenge of predicting **loan defaults** ‚Äî a critical task in financial risk assessment.  
It combines a **machine learning model (XGBoost with SMOTE)** to handle imbalanced data and a **Power BI dashboard** to provide actionable insights for stakeholders.

We trained a model to **classify clients based on the likelihood of defaulting on a loan**, using engineered features from financial and behavioral data.  
The model outputs a probability score for each client, allowing threshold-based decisions and prioritization of high-risk cases.

## üìä Visualizations

Here are some key visualizations from the model training and validation process:

| Important Features | ROC Curve | Confusion matrix |
|----------------|--------------------|-------------------------|
| ![Important Features](top15features.JPG) | ![ROC Curve](ROC.JPG) | ![Confusion Matrix](matrix.JPG) |

These visualizations provide insight into:
- **Most influential features** in the model, helping interpret predictions and feature importance.
- **ROC Curve**, showing the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
- **Confusion Matrix**, visualizing classification performance and the balance between correctly and incorrectly predicted classes.

> These metrics highlight the trade-off between precision and recall in imbalanced datasets, ensuring that more defaults are correctly identified (high recall), even if it means a few false positives. Despite the model achieving high overall performance, the recall and F1-score for the default class (1) are naturally lower compared to the non-default class (0). This is expected due to the strong class imbalance in the original dataset, where only about 4% of the records represent defaults. In the context of bank credit risk assessment, this imbalance is common ‚Äî most clients repay their loans on time, while only a small fraction default. Even after applying SMOTE to balance the training data, perfect detection of the minority class remains challenging. However, the model still performs well, achieving a recall of 60% and precision of 81% for the default class, which is a solid result in financial applications where predicting defaults is more critical than achieving perfect accuracy.

#### **Dashboard Features**
- **KPIs:**
  - High Risk Client Rate
  - Overdue Client Rate
  - Average PDN (Probability of Default)
  - Number of Clients
- **Visuals:**
  - Risk Category breakdown by Age Group, and risk level.
  - Income analysis by Age Group and Education Level
  - Client demographics by Gender and Education Level
  - Geographic analysis by Region
- **Interactive Filters (Slicers):**
  - AgeGroup, RiskCategory, Region
